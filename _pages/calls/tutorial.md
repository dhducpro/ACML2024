title: Call for Tutorials
---



The ACML 2024 organizing committee invites proposals for tutorials to be held alongside the conference on 8th December 2024 in Hanoi, Vietnam. The conference aims to provide a leading international forum for researchers in machine learning and related fields to share new results and ideas and discuss emerging topics.  The tutorial session will be at the National Convention Center in Hanoi, co-located with the ACCV conference.

We invite proposals for half-day (2.5-hour) tutorials on machine learning topics and emerging, related fields. Ideally, the tutorial should attract a wide audience, provide a broad coverage of core research problems in its chosen research area, elucidate technical solutions, discuss their key insights, and stimulate future work. The tutorial should be broad enough to provide a basic introduction to the chosen area and deep enough on the most critical topics.

### Submission Instructions
A tutorial proposal should include:
<br>
1) Two-page (maximum) description: The PDF document should include an overview of the topic, a discussion on the relevance and significance for the machine learning community, the relevant research areas, the prior knowledge required of the potential audience, and a brief outline of the tutorial structure. Please include the distribution of subtopics in the case of multiple presenters.
<br>
2) Speaker Bios: Upload a single PDF with a one-page bio for each presenter. Bios should cover the presenters' expertise related to the tutorial topic.
Submit your proposal through this form: <https://forms.gle/HmnNe6cDqBikun21A>{:target="_blank"}
<br>
If the tutorial is accepted, the presenters are required to present the tutorial in person.
