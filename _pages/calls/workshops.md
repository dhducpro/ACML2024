The ACML 2024 organizing committee invites proposals for workshops to be conducted in conjunction with the [16th Asian Conference on Machine Learning (ACML)](https://www.acml-conf.org/2024/), held jointly with the [17th Asian Conference on Computer Vision (ACCV)](https://accv2024.org/){:target="_blank"} on December 8th, 2024 in Hanoi, Vietnam. The ACML conference aims at providing a leading international forum for researchers in machine learning and related fields to share new results, ideas and discuss emerging topics.

We welcome proposals for workshops on various aspects of machine learning and its related fields. Joint tutorial-workshop proposals are also encouraged. The proposals should highlight original research contributions, with a particular focus on showcasing advancements from Asia. Submissions from under-represented groups/regions are especially welcome. In alignment with the main conference, all workshops will be held in person, fostering an enriching environment for participants to actively engage in interactive discussions, explore networking opportunities, and foster collaborations with local communities.

### SUBMISSION INSTRUCTIONS
A workshop proposal should include the following:
1. Title and abstract
2. Overview and outline of the workshop (half-day or full-day)
3. Secured and potential invited speakers
4. Previous experience organizing a workshop (if any)

For points 3 and 5, please provide specific details regarding efforts on diversity, equity, and inclusion.
